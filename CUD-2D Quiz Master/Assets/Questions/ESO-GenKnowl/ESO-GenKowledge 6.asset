  question: How many classes are available to ESO Players?
  answer: 7
  correctionText: "ESO started with 4 classes -- Dragon Knight, Night Blade, Sorceror,
    and Templars. The advent of Morrowind saw the introduction of the 5th Class,
    Warden, while Year of the Dragon introduced the Necromancer as the 6th Class.
    With the release of Necrom (June 2023) and the introduction of the Archanist,
    the total is increased to 7.\r"
